# AutoInventory
Automatically creates Inventory/Transfer/WriteOff ticket on HighlandsStores (HS) API

This tool provides similar functionality as https://github.com/baddles/HCS-AutoInventory, in which the application will read from a configured Excel form that contains Item Code from HS's Inventory data, and automatically creates the ticket from the Excel sheet. This aims to reduce the amount of manual input that user has to input on HS UI. However, the goal of this tool is to rewrite the above tool using C#/ASP.NET instead of Python in order to unify the underlying architecture for better code management.

As I (author) am no longer associated with HC (last updated form: Feb 2025). The Excel form file will not be updated to reflect any of the new item's code. 

Partial support shall be provided, but not at a regular level.

This will only be a simple console application, no GUI (which is why this tool is meant to aim for future developers).

Partial documentation shall be provided in the future to help users understand how the tool works.
